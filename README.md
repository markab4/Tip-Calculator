# Tip Calculator
An Android app that outputs tip amount and total amount each person should pay.

## How to Use
* User enters as input the amount of the check and the number of people splitting the check
* User presses on the "Compute Tip" button
* Any errors in input, such as empty or invalid (e.g. negative) values are visualized using a Toast
* The app produces as output both the amount of the tip and total amount each person should pay for a 15%, 20%, and 25% tip.
* Output values assume that the check is split evenly and are rounded to the nearest integer
